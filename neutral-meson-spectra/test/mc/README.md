Analysis of MC data
-------------------

## Explanation

- [x] Nonlinearity
	- Extract parameters for nonlinearity function `nonlinearity.py`
	- Compare different versions of mc corrected for nonlinearity/weighed `different_versions.py`
	- Compare different MC productions and data`compare_data_mc.py`

- [x] Efficiency
	- Calculate efficiency for different productions `efficiency.py`

- [ ] Contributions from differet sources
	- Compare rates from different sources `pi0_sources.py`
	- Generated spectra of $\pi^{0}$s `generated.py`
	- Reconstructed spectra of $\pi^{0}$s `reconstructed.py`
	- Feed-down correction `feeddown.py`
